## Course Summary

**htmx** is one of the hottest properties ðŸ”¥ in web development today, and for
good reason. This framework, along with the libraries and techniques
introduced in this course, will have you writing the best Python web apps
you've ever written: clean, fast, and interactive without all that frontend
overhead.

If you are a Django developer that has wanted to build more dynamic sites, but
just don't want to (or can't) write a significant portion of your app in a
rich frontend JavaScript framework, **you'll absolutely love htmx**. This
library lets you write Python code you love and still add that client-side
interactive aspect.

## What's this course about and how is it different?

**htmx** is a very compelling technology. It's one of the first legitimate
libraries that delivers on the promise of dynamic, interactive web
applications without complex JavaScript. **htmx allows us to write server-side
code in any language** (Python in our case) and, through a few simple HTML
attributes, bring our pages to life.

This is the only course (that we're aware of) that shows you the full
lifecycle of building Python and Django-based applications centered around
**htmx**. Unlike basic tutorials where you'll find only just quick coverage of
a simple feature, we take a full-fledged web app and extend it by adding four
real-world features all building upon **htmx**.

**Moreover, we show you the right way to use htmx with Django and Python**. The
resulting code is incredibly clean and would impress almost any professional
web developer.


## What topics are covered

In this course, you will:

- **See how htmx differs** from common JavaScript front-end frameworks such as Vue and React.
- **Understand the server-side exchange** enabled by htmx attributes (e.g. `hx-trigger`).
- Add **click to edit** to an existing data-driven Django application.
- **Add deep linking to our dynamic web application**, allowing us to share links into interactive segments.
- Add **active search** to an existing data-driven Django application.
- **Implement browser history for htmx actions** (allowing back and forth navigation, and deep linking).
- Add **infinite scroll** to our app.
- **Distinguish between full page requests and partial htmx requests** within a single view method in Django.
- **Combine htmx with Bootstrap** to take advantage of both frameworks.
- And lots more
